            <p>Basil, otherwise known as Slaysil, is a very energetic white, slightly crusty and trusty, dog (bichon) . She gets princess treatment in her household, but also out in public. As a consequence, she is very clingy and loves to lick, especially in the face.</p>
            <p>She endeavors in multiple hobbies and activities, which include flying, licking, standing on two legs, ringing bells, and jumping through hula hoops.</p>
